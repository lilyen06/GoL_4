    Syntax: new Pattern(rows,cols,game,numAlive)

            cols: int, defines the number of cols a pattern should fit in
            game: Game object
            numAlive: int, defines how many cells will be turned on in the rows x cols area

    Syntax: Pattern.randomize()
        Description: Populates and draws a random pattern
        Return: CellArray (grid) of pattern

Plotter Class Methods and Properties:

NAME							DESCRIPTION

constructor(x, y)				Instantiates the values of an instance of a class (the length of the axes)

initialize()					Draws X and Y axes using the values from the constructor

drawPop(x, y)					Draws the points on the X and Y axes where the Y represents population and X represents generation (frames)

drawPosition(x, y)				Draws the points on the axes where the X and Y represents the average and Y position of all alive cells

clear()							Clears the entire canvas


Plotter constructor()
	Definition and Usage

	Return Value
		None.

Plotter initialize()
	Definition and Usage
		The initialize() method draws the x and y axes from the values instantiated by the constructor()
		The initialize() method draws the y-axis from (20, 20) to (20, this.yAxis)

			Where this.xAxis and this.yAxis are values instantiated in or passed to the constructor

	Syntax
		plotter.initialize();

	Parameters
