Mutator Functions:
    Syntax: new Mutator()
        Description: instantiates a Mutator

    Syntax: Mutator.differences(rows, cols, pattern)
        Description: A helper method for moveLonely() which returns the differences between the average position 
                    of a pattern and the point given by the rows and cols
        Paramaters:
            rows: an int defining the rows(y) of the comparative point
            cols: an int defining the cols(x) of the comparative point
            pattern: a CellArray which is used to determine its average position
        Return:
            x: an int between -1 and 1, meant to move the point given towards the average x-position of the pattern
            y: an int between -1 and 1, meant to move the point given towards the average y-position of the pattern

    Syntax: Mutator.moveLonely(pattern)
        Description: moveLonely identifies the live cell with the least amount of neighbours, and moves it towards
                    the average position of the pattern
        Parameters: pattern: a CellArray to be modified
        Return: pattern: a modified CellArray

    Syntax: Mutator.addPoint(pattern)
        Description: addPoint adds a point near to the average position of a pattern
        Parameters: pattern: a CellArray to be modified
        Return: pattern: a modified CellArray

    Syntax: Mutator.killPoint(pattern)
        Description: removes a point near to the average position. If all nine of the points surrounding the average 
                    position are empty, adds a point instead
        Parameters: pattern: a CellArray to be modified
        Return: pattern: a modified CellArray

Pattern Functions:
    Syntax: new Pattern(rows,cols,game,numAlive)
        Description: Populates the class variables of a Pattern object
        Parameters:
            rows: int, defines the number of rows a pattern should fit in
            cols: int, defines the number of cols a pattern should fit in
            game: Game object
            numAlive: int, defines how many cells will be turned on in the rows x cols area

    Syntax: Pattern.randomize()
        Description: Populates and draws a random pattern
        Return: CellArray (grid) of pattern
