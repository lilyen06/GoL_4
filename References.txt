Syntax: Mutator.differences(rows, cols, pattern)
    Description: A helper method for moveLonely() which returns the differences between the average position 
                 of a pattern and the point given by the rows and cols
    Paramaters:
        rows: an int defining the rows(y) of the comparative point
        cols: an int defining the cols(x) of the comparative point
        pattern: a CellArray which is used to determine its average position
    Return:
        x: an int between -1 and 1, meant to move the point given towards the average x-position of the pattern
        y: an int between -1 and 1, meant to move the point given towards the average y-position of the pattern
